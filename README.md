# My First React Native Expo Project

Welcome to my very first React Native project! ðŸŽ‰

In this project, I am exploring and learning React Native with Expo. I have also integrated **Gluestack UI** and **Tailwind CSS** for building modern, responsive, and stylish mobile interfaces.

## Features

- Built using **React Native** and **Expo**
- Styled with **Tailwind CSS**
- UI components powered by **Gluestack UI**
- Simple and clean mobile interface
- Designed for learning and experimentation
- **API Fetch:** Communicate with backend APIs for dynamic data
- **NFC / RFID Scan:** Read NFC/RFID tags for inventory or access functionality
- **Printing Feature:** Print receipts or vouchers directly from the app
- Fully functional on **iOS** and **Android**
- Designed for rapid prototyping and experimentation

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
